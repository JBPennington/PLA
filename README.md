# PLA

PLA (Portable Linear Algebra) is designed to be a portable, single header, MISRA compliant C, linear algebra library.

It's been built off of [datenwolf's linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h).

I cannot guarantee MISRA compliance at this time, but it is compliant to my knowledge.

## Cloning

Their is no need to clone, you could simply copy the header. If you'd like to clone and test the lib. Execute the following.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JBPennington/PLA.git
```

-- or to clone as a submodule and integrate as a static lib --

```
git submodule add https://github.com/JBPennington/PLA.git
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
